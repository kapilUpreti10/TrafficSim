# Traffic Simulation Project

## Overview

This project is a **Traffic Simulation** application that models and visualizes traffic movement in a city-like environment. It utilizes a graph-based representation of roads and intersections, allowing vehicles to navigate efficiently.

## Features

- Visual representation of city roads and traffic.
- Graph-based road network with intersections.
- Simulation of vehicle movement.
- Customizable settings and parameters.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have **Python 3.x** installed. You may also need the following dependencies:

```bash
pip install pygame networkx matplotlib
```

### Running the Simulation

Navigate to the project directory and run:

```bash
python traffic/app.py
```
